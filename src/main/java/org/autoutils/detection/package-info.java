/**
 * This package encompasses a suite of utilities designed to enhance interactions with web elements within a web page,
 * facilitating more robust and reliable automation testing. It primarily focuses on the identification, visibility,
 * and synchronization of web elements, ensuring they are in the appropriate state for interaction.
 * <p>
 * Key components include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.autoutils.detection.ElementFinder} - Facilitates locating single or multiple web elements
 *       directly or with customized wait conditions, supporting both presence and visibility checks. It is instrumental
 *       in abstracting direct Selenium WebDriver calls for element retrieval, thereby simplifying test scripts.</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.autoutils.detection.ElementVisibilityHandler} - Specializes in assessing the visibility state
 *       of web elements and collections of elements or locators. It leverages {@link org.autoutils.detection.wait}
 *       strategies to wait for specific visibility conditions, making it crucial for tests that require dynamic content interaction.</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.autoutils.detection.wait} - Contains sophisticated waiting strategies that extend beyond simple
 *       presence or visibility checks. This subpackage offers reusable wait methods for various conditions, enhancing test
 *       efficiency and reliability by reducing boilerplate code and focusing on synchronization with web page states.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Together, these utilities provide a comprehensive toolkit for handling common challenges in web automation, such as dynamic
 * content loading and asynchronous updates, by offering a layered approach to element detection and interaction.
